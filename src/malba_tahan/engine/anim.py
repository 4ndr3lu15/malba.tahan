"""Pure, UI-free animation helpers.

These functions hold the *math* of the engine's animations so the timing logic
can be unit-tested without a running Textual app. The widgets in
:mod:`malba_tahan.engine.widgets` apply these results to real Textual timers and
``animate`` calls.

Keeping them pure also means an animation never depends on wall-clock state it
cannot see: given the same inputs you always get the same frame.
